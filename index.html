    Step 68
    All pages should begin with <!DOCTYPE html>. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the 
    browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications. Add this declaration as the first line of the code.
-->
<!Doctype html>
<!--
    Step 67
    Notice that the entire contents of the page are nested within an html element. All other elements must be 
    descendants of this html element. Add the lang attribute with the value en to the opening html tag to specify 
    that the language of the page is English.
-->
<html lang="en">
<!--
    Step 65
    Notice that everything you've added to the page so far is inside the body element. All page content elements 
    that should be rendered to the page go inside the body element. However, other important information goes inside 
    the head element. Add a head element above the body element.
    
    Step 66
    The title element determines what browsers show in the title bar or tab for the page. Add a title element 
    within the head element using the text below:
    CatPhotoApp
-->  
    <head>
        <!--
            Step 69
            You can set browser behavior by adding self-closing meta elements in the head. Here's an example:
            <meta attribute="value">
            Tell the browser to parse the markup into multiple languages by creating a meta element as a 
            child of the head element. Set its charset attribute to UTF-8.
        -->
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>
            CatPhotoApp
        </title>
    </head>

            <h2>Cats Form</h2>
            <!--The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example, 
                <form action="/submit-url"></form> tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the 
                path /submit-url. Add an action attribute with the value 
                https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo to the form element.-->
            <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
                <!--The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements, 
                    input elements are self-closing and do not need closing tags. Nest an input element in the 
                    form element.-->
                <!--
                    Step 39
                    In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, 
                    you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being 
                    submitted. For example, you could use the following syntax for an email address text field: 
                    <input type="text" name="email">.Add the name attribute with the value catphotourl to your 
                    text field.-->
                <!--
                    Step 40
                    Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an 
                    input. For example, <input type="text" placeholder="Email address">. Add the placeholder text 
                    cat photo URL to your input element.-->
                <!--
                    Step 41
                    To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the required 
                    attribute to an input element. There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. Instead, just add 
                    the word required to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.
                    
                    Step 44
                    You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options. 
                    Here is an example of a radio button with the option of cat: <input type="radio"> cat. Remember 
                    that input elements are self-closing. Before the text input, add a radio button with the option 
                    set as: Indoor

                    Step 45
                    label elements are used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element 
                    itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers). For example, <label>
                    <input type="radio"> cat</label> makes it so clicking the word cat also selects the corresponding 
                    radio button. Nest your radio button inside a label element.

                    Step 46
                    The id attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each id attribute's value must be 
                    unique from all other id values for the entire page. Add an id attribute with the value indoor 
                    to the radio button. When elements have multiple attributes, the order of the attributes doesn't 
                    matter.

                    Step 47
                    Create another radio button below the first one. Nest it inside a label element with Outdoor as 
                    the label text. Give the radio button an id attribute with outdoor as the value.

                    Step 48
                    Notice that both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. To make it so selecting one 
                    radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a name attribute with the 
                    same value. Add the name attribute with the value indoor-outdoor to both radio buttons.

                    Step 49
                    If you select the Indoor radio button and submit the form, the form data for the button is based 
                    on its name and value attributes. Since your radio buttons do not have a value attribute, the 
                    form data will include indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful when you have multiple buttons.
                    Add a value attribute to both radio buttons. For convenience, set the button's value attribute 
                    to the same value as its id attribute.

                    Step 50
                    The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. 
                    fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line. Nest the 
                    Indoor and Outdoor radio buttons within a fieldset element, and don't forget to indent the radio 
                    buttons.
                    
                    Step 51
                    The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. It gives users 
                    context about what they should enter into that part of the form. Add a legend element with the 
                    text Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat? above both of the radio buttons.
                -->
                <fieldset>
                    <label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor" checked>Indoor </label>
                    <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor">Outdoor </label>
                    <input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
                </fieldset>
                
                <!--
                    Step 54
                    Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer. For example, 
                    here's a checkbox with the option of tacos: <input type="checkbox"> tacos. Under the legend 
                    element you just added, add an input with its type attribute set to checkbox and give it the 
                    option of: Loving

                    Step 56
                    There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. You can nest 
                    the text within a label element and add a for attribute with the same value as the input 
                    element's id attribute. Associate the text Loving with the checkbox by only nesting the text 
                    Loving in a label element and place it to the right side of the checkbox input element.
                    
                    Step 57
                    Add the name attribute with the value personality to the checkbox input element. While you won't
                    notice this in the browser, doing this makes it easier for a server to process your web form, 
                    especially when there are multiple checkboxes.

                    Step 58
                    Add another checkbox after the one you just added. The id attribute value should be lazy and 
                    the name attribute value should be the same as the last checkbox. Also add a label element to 
                    the right of the new checkbox with the text Lazy. Make sure to associate the label element with 
                    the new checkbox using the for attribute.

                    Step 59
                    Add a final checkbox after the previous one with an id attribute value of energetic. The name 
                    attribute should be the same as the previous checkbox. Also add a label element to the right of 
                    the new checkbox with text Energetic. Make sure to associate the label element with the new 
                    checkbox.

                    Step 60
                    Like radio buttons, form data for selected checkboxes are name / value attribute pairs. While the value
                    attribute is optional, it's best practice to include it with any checkboxes or radio buttons on the page.
                    Add a value attribute to each checkbox. For convenience, set each checkbox's value attribute to the same 
                    value as its id attribute.

                    Step 61
                    In order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the 
                    checked attribute to it. There's no need to set a value to the checked attribute. Instead, 
                    just add the word checked to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other 
                    attributes. Make the first radio button and the first checkbox selected by default.
                -->
                
                <fieldset>
                    <legend>What's your cat's personality?</legend>
                    <!--
                        <input type="checkbox">Loving
                    -->
                    <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="loving" checked> <label for="loving">Loving</label>
                    <input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="lazy"> <label for="lazy">Lazy</label>
                    <input id="energetic" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="energetic"> <label for="energetic"> Energetic</label>
                </fieldset>

                <!--
                    Step 42
                    Use the button element to create a clickable button. For example, <button>Click Here</button> 
                    creates a button with the text Click Here. Add a button element with the text Submit below the 
                    input element. The default behavior of clicking a form button without any attributes submits 
                    the form to the location specified in the form's action attribute.
                    Step 43 
                    Even though you added your button below the text input, they appear next to each other on the 
                    page. That's because both input and button elements are inline elements, which don't appear on 
                    new lines. The button you added will submit the form by default. However, relying on default 
                    behavior may cause confusion. Add the type attribute with the value submit to the button to make 
                    it clear that it is a submit button.
                -->
                <button type="sumbit">Submit</button>
